![Web Summit in Lisbon](../img/websummit18-300.jpg "Web Summit in Lisbon")

November was an exciting and productive month for the Decred Project. The community began to reap the benefits of Politeia development with live proposal voting and the first proposals being approved. Stakeholders collectively voiced key steering decisions regarding the future of contractor management, public relations, and research all from the comfort of their Decred wallet of choice (Decrediton or command line with the politeiavoter tool).

Additional companies and individuals joined the Decred ecosystem while some long term contributors self-organized according to interests and abilities.

Amidst the excitement, growth and change in the community, Decred development continued with high levels of activity and progress.

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Two big changes started last month were merged after extensive testing. First one is [reversed UTXO set semantics](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1471) and its accompanying [database migration](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1520), an important change that provides simpler and more efficient handling of unspent outputs. A side effect of this is that full block reorganization tests run 40% faster. Second one is [optimized reorganization handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1500). New [--maxsameip](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1517) argument allows to limit the number of connections with the same IP address. A fix to an ultra rare bug was [ported](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1533) from upstream btcd.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): Added new RPCs to [use ticketbuyer v2](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1307), to [get single ticket](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/1317) and to [sweep account](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1098). Added [ability](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1282) to use alternative database backend, this is useful for mobile platforms. Fixed bugs: [address watching](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1320) for heavily used wallets, [missed or double spent transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1321), [missing addresses and transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/1333).

Work started on a big change to improve the calculation of ["locked" balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1330) that should address some issues for solo, VSP and split ticket voters.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): Added features: [new page](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1755) to choose SPV or full mode and display of the Decred [Treasury balance](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1764). Automatic ticket buying was switched to [ticketbuyer v2](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1744). It has fewer options and is simpler to use than v1 thanks to the stabilized ticket prices. Now all the user needs to specify is balance to maintain, account and stakepool to use. Startup performance of [large wallets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1727) was improved. Politeia integration saw improvements as well including [more responsive](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1825) proposal loading and [notifications for new proposals and votes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1835). UI/UX tuneups: updated [proposal list design](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1771), [overview design improvements](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1818), updated [account icons](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1811) and improvements to the [navigation icons and microanimations](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1809). To ensure continued cross-platform stability and performance Decrediton was [updated to Electron 3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1777).

The features mentioned above were merged into the master branch and will be available in the next release of Decrediton.

Trezor: Model T firmware version 2.0.9 was [released](https://blog.trezor.io/firmware-updates-2-0-9-and-1-7-1-developed-by-the-community-for-the-community-c4b965741ca3) with Decred support. Cheers @matheusd for making it happen! Now our Decrediton developers can work on the integration.

Beware: A fake Trezor One was discovered, check the [blog](https://blog.trezor.io/psa-non-genuine-trezor-devices-979b64e359a7) how to verify and shop for a genuine device.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): [politeiavoter](https://github.com/decred/politeia/tree/master/politeiavoter) privacy and performance was improved by randomized [ticket voting order](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/565), randomized [delays between votes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/579) and [filtering](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/562) of already voted tickets. By popular demand an email notification system was created to support awareness about [new proposals](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/848) and [comments](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/919). Verification of cast votes was made possible by the [search by ticket](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/899) feature where the search is performed on the client side to protect privacy. [Comment permalinks](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/753) and [distinguished author comments](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/877) are now live. A new ["Abandoned" status](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/889) was added to handle abandoned proposals. "Finished" tab was [split](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/904) into "Approved" and "Rejected" tabs. SVG support was [disabled](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/626) until proper tooling to sanitize SVG is found. A [small vulnerability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/563) was patched, thanks to @iemlisted for reporting. Lots of smaller improvements and bugfixes.

Note that some of these features will be available on the [mainnet site](https://proposals.decred.org/) after the next deployment.

Work started on the features to [view diffs](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/754) between proposal revisions and to [highlight new comments](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/897).

[Android wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): mainnet pre-release version is available on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet)! The Play Store version includes updated currency conversion that shows [fee in local currency](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/192) and [advanced password protection](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/134) with the ability to [lock all data](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/187) and to use an [access pin code](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/180). This version also includes a security menu which allows users to [sign messages](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/226) proving ownership of addresses. Another community sourced innovation is the [Hidden Account feature](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/175). Hidden accounts allow mobile users to keep funds in their mobile wallet which will not be displayed on the main screen balance total. The added privacy this feature offers will be useful for people buying and selling Decred at local meetups. Fund transfer between accounts was simplified with [dropdown selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/119).

[iOS wallet](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): the wallet is currently in beta testing and will require additional development cycles to incorporate the feature set available on Android.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): New features integrated into the codebase this month include a [network hashrate chart](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/723), the addition of the [Decred Treasury](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/784) to nav menu, showing that [an output is spent in mempool](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/825) and showing [tx type on address view](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/741). Time grouping accuracy was [improved](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/776).

Preview of the [new home page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/718), along with all new features is available on the [alpha site](https://alpha.dcrdata.org/nexthome) which runs v3.2.0-pre built from master. A more stable [beta site](https://beta.dcrdata.org/) runs v3.1.0-beta. The most stable [explorer.dcrdata.org](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/) runs v3.0.2-release. For consistency with Insight links, the latter is also accessible at [mainnet.dcrdata.org](https://mainnet.dcrdata.org/).

On the dev side, @gozart [started](https://matrix.to/#/!LmKzrmxJIXNHNiEmIh:decred.org/$154214092215095eeuIR:decred.org) an epic refactoring effort to [convert](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/805) javascript codebase to ES6 modules, add webpack for front end dev tooling and production asset bundling, enforce code style and convert CSS to [SCSS partials](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/839).

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool): this is the software used by most, if not all VSPs. The README document was [updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/285) with build instructions for Go modules. Transaction links were changed from Insight to [dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/264).

Several privacy issues were discovered and discussed. A patch is being tested to replace Google recaptcha with [self-hosted CAPTCHA](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/281) to avoid fingerprinting of stakeholders - VSP operators are welcome to join testing. Request to Cloudflare [was removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/283). An issue to [make email optional](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/274) was raised.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): the beta continued to grow during November with split tickets filled daily. Two VSPs that integrated ticket splitting, [decredbrasil.com](https://stake.decredbrasil.com/) and [decredvoting.com](https://decredvoting.com/), released an educational [walk-through video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGoUQK0g24) in Portuguese and English and a general [ticket splitting overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9vhpby/decred_ticket_splitting_overview/), in addition to guides on their sites. The software was updated to support SPV light mode. Please read the [issue](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/issues/29) to consider privacy implications.

Ticket splitting support groups exist both on the [Decred Slack](https://decred.slack.com) and in the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/dcrticketsplit) where [VSP agnostic instructions](https://t.me/dcrticketsplit/2666) are available.

[design](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign): @kyle at [Firethought](https://firethought.net/) announced a [Decred icon motion pack](https://medium.com/@firethought/base-iconset18-motion-pack-readme-a96f96e868) which promises to bring "more engaging Decred application experiences" and builds on the icon pack designed by [EETER](http://www.eeter.co/).

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): November was a huge month for documentation with a variety of community supported changes and updates. The [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/522652954ea7998f3fca95b9c4ca8907820eb785877dcf7fba92307131818c75) passed which confirmed a community desire to change "PoS Mining" to "PoS Voting" and "stakepool" to "Voting Service Provider (VSP)" in all Decred documentation. First batch of changes is [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/590). Updates were made to [adopt the term "Decred Treasury"](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/690). For those looking to take a deeper dive into Politeia a new [Navigating Politeia Data](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/navigating-politeia-data/) page was created. The long awaited [Decred Glossary](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/675) was completed and published in part due to a huge effort by @s_ben and many people who supported the work with feedback and suggestions. We highly recommend utilizing [the glossary](https://docs.decred.org/glossary/) to improve our shared community understanding.

Dev activity stats for November: 266 active PRs, 268 master commits, 45K added and 25K deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 3-11 developers per repository. ([chart](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1070413196555636736))

Several people started hacking on Politeia data in #proposals and #research. @snr01 shared [charts of voting evolution](https://github.com/snr01/PiVotingCharts).

Low quality proposals cluttering Politeia were discussed in depth and multiple ideas were suggested. @richardred gave a nice overview of this in [Politeia Digest #4](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/politeia-digest-issue-4-nov-7-nov-13-2018-685e18e7491a).

The #proposals room is very active and hosts many insightful discussions about Politeia and upcoming proposals. Join on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org) or [Slack](https://decred.slack.com/messages/CDL5DRZU6).

The weekly Politeia Digest by @richardred covers all important activity around Politeia in greater detail, check [issue 4](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/politeia-digest-issue-4-nov-7-nov-13-2018-685e18e7491a), [issue 5](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-5-nov-14-nov-20-2018-62e8aed223b7) and [issue 6](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-6-nov-21-nov-27-2018-3260d03d26a1) released this month (and [issue 7](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-7-nov-28-dec-4-2018-bac012414d36) in early December). Reddit discussions can be found with [this search query](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/search?include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&q=politeia%20digest).

## Network

Hashrate: November's hashrate opened at around 156 PH/s and closed around 159 PH/s, reaching the low of 125 PH/s and high of 234 PH/s in between. BeePool's share varied between 19-30%, F2Pool 15-46%, Luxor 1.6-4%, and Coinmine 1.9-4%. Unknown hashrate stayed between 25-50% with lows of 15% and spikes to 75%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Fun fact: the expected total number of hashes it took to produce the current chain tip is getting [pretty close](https://matrix.to/#/!NNzHoaSdnsbZDQOXJr:decred.org/$154234658617707JUWKl:decred.org) to the number of hashes needed to do a birthday attack on a single RIPEMD160.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 103 DCR (+3.2). The price varied between 96.7 and 110.2 DCR. Locked amount was 4.02-4.18 million DCR, which corresponded to 45.9-47.2% of the available supply.

After the price dropped to 96.7, 1,378 tickets were purchased in a single window that bumped the price to 110.2 after 9 subsequent price increases. This is the new all time high on the new [sdiff algorithm](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0001/dcp-0001.mediawiki) that has been in effect since July 2017.

[@permabull nino](https://twitter.com/ImacallyouJawdy) shared [a few](https://twitter.com/ImacallyouJawdy/status/1065272779447009281) [more](https://twitter.com/ImacallyouJawdy/status/1060990375064522752) charts showing an uptick in deposited DCR.

Nodes: as of Dec 1 there are 204 public listening nodes and 332 normal nodes per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 6.5% are v1.4.0(pre) dev builds (+0.5%), 50% on v1.3.0 (+5%), 25% on v1.2.0 (-3%), 11% on v1.1.2 (-3%), 5% on v1.1.0.

## Mining

Obelisk [began producing](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/?u=393b2698d17bdfe48ac0422ac&id=28096412c5) Batch 2-5 units and expects to begin shipping in early December, after that it will take ~4 weeks to fulfill all orders. On Dec 4 they announced several new offers: SC1 hashing boards can be purchased and installed into DCR1 units, DCR1 can be converted to Batch 6 SC1 or sold back to Obelisk. The details are in the newsletter [post](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/?u=393b2698d17bdfe48ac0422ac&id=88576cef2a).

The Whatsminer D1 [turned out](https://twitter.com/Pangolinminer/status/1061521332498624512) to be 48 TH/s, 9% up from expected 44 TH/s. The price was bumped by $350 to $4,850 [from Pangolin](https://pangolinminer.com/product/whatsminer-dcr-with-psu-shipout-on-dec-5/). MicroBT's price changes and shipment delay were handled differently by resellers and drew [varied opinions](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5068845.msg47865706#msg47865706) from the community about best practices.

Bitmain announced the Decred [Antminer DR5](https://shop.bitmain.com.cn/product/detail?pid=0002018111918225889369SR3N9s0646) with 34 TH/s at 1800 W, price CNY 19,000 (USD 2,750) and shipping late December. European [importers of the DR5](https://www.antminerdistribution.com/antminer-dr5/) are listing tentative availability the week of Dec 21 and prices ranging from [USD 3,299](https://french.alibaba.com/product-detail/asic-miner-bitmain-antminer-dr5-34th-blake256r14-dcr-digging-machine-decred-mining-machine-ant-miner-with-psu-60820041330.html) to [EUR 3,291](https://miningwholesale.eu/product/bitmain-antminer-dr5-34th/) (USD 3,724).

Video review of Obelisk DCR1 was published on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0QjhvaoQpc). Photos of innovative Canadian cooling [leaked](https://matrix.to/#/!NNzHoaSdnsbZDQOXJr:decred.org/$154146601110108OYpjf:decred.org) in chat.

## Adoption

UK holiday shoppers have another option to spend Decred this season. MonetaryUnit [announced](https://twitter.com/monetaryunit/status/1062127668769050626) that DCR is [accepted](https://blog.flubit.com/pay-crypto-flubit-com/) on [Flubit](https://flubit.com/), a UK marketplace they acquired in the summer. Some insights from the [blog post](https://blog.flubit.com/crypto-coins-drive-xmas-strategy-largest-eshop-200bn-cryptocurrency-industry-goes-mainstream-online-shopping-flubit-com/): Flubit is a 8 year-old eCommerce company that served over 3 million shoppers last year, the cryptocurrency integration is seamless for the merchants.

[Coinstop](https://coinstop.io/), Australian reseller of Trezor, Ledger and KeepKey devices, now [accepts](https://twitter.com/COINSTOPio/status/1067927790320664576) DCR.

## Outreach

Outreach for the month of November was mostly of the planning variety, though many local meetups did take place across the world, including important events in Melbourne and Ho Chi Minh City. @eSizeDave and @joshuam are doing a great job spreading Decred in Asia Pacific.

@Dustorf released an [extensive blog](https://medium.com/@dlefebvr/pr-in-politeia-process-progress-and-pitching-in-d88771183dd4) detailing the process of Ditto's proposal approval from preliminary vetting, to proposal discussion and voting, to the next steps in planning and executing. The blog received a ton of pre-release feedback [in #marketing](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$1542337694484551cyyyn:matrix.org) showing the power and skill of our writers. Much work was done aggregating data to upload and share with the Ditto team so we can hit the ground running in December. @Dustorf had an onboarding call on Monday, Dec 3, and he and @jy-p plan to meet with Ditto in person later that week.

Per @Dustorf's blog, the initial focus will be on gaining community alignment on positioning and messaging, then rolling that into some web updates while also planning for 2019 execution of the communications strategy. Ditto will engage publicly on Matrix in [#marketing](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org), and sensitive information will be reserved for a new Matrix room called "Ditto PR". If you think you can help and would like to be invited to this room, please reach out to @jz or @Dustorf to be added.

December will be a month of planning, and @jy-p will present "Applications of Blockchain Timestamping" at The North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, USA on Jan 16-18. Other events will likely be confirmed the first week of December and will be made public in #marketing.

Besides planning mid and long term strategy our PR will also act on current opportunities, as explained [in #marketing](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154385900031974cIHsk:decred.org).

@Haon started a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/a1bsv8/what_to_expect_from_the_ditto_partnership/) on Reddit about what to expect from the Ditto partnership and shared thoughts based on his experience with the Decred community and collaboration with the previous PR firm (PRWithBrains).

## Events

Attended:

* Training and planning session by Raedah Group in Portland, USA. ([photo](https://twitter.com/raedahgroup/status/1058493594452004864))
* [Web Summit](https://twitter.com/WebSummit) in Lisbon, Portugal. Was a very busy event and a lot of people approached Decred's booth. @moo31337 [introduced](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1059790693802094592) Decred to Portugal's prime minister Antonio Costa. @vj and @jholdstock published a report [here](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/blob/master/reports/20181106-Web-Summit-Lisbon.md). @karamble, who "did a good job of using baby and grown up stakey to illustrate ticket stages" posted more notes [here](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154258437019744ukkoN:decred.org) regarding the proliferation of private blockchain companies.

* [Token Forum](https://www.thetokenforum.com/) in Seattle, USA. @oregonisaac presented on Decred and Blockchain Governance. @Eli-RG [noted](https://decred.slack.com/archives/C66363X44/p1542039292115100) that the talk was a big success with lots of feedback coming in like: "most interesting talk of the day" and "you've opened my eyes" or, as one of the organizers put it: "He's...great!!!!".

* [FinTech Melbourne Community Networking](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-FinTech-Startups-Meetup/events/256195153/) in Melbourne, Australia. @eSizeDave [reports](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154217119815341VaPZS:decred.org): "It was a great turnout especially considering only a week to promote on MeetUp. People were happy and many asked if we'd hold this event more regularly, which is of course our plan. We had people there from financial institutions, FinTech regulatory analysis and advocacy professionals, startups, and also other blockchain projects. Two data scientists from ANZ Bank told me they'd proactively googled for such an event and coincidentally found it, having not already being FinTech Melbourne MeetUp group members. So I guess it goes to show there's demand for such events. This was a good outcome, so we'll be putting in more effort into the next FinTech focused event.". See also a follow-up [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154220759315790UMKqT:decred.org) about why to focus on "fintech" when it is an industry that Decred is supposed to disrupt.

* [BlockchainFiesta](http://blockchainfiesta.io/) in Krakow, Poland. @kozel and @donmario gave an interview to [FXMag](https://www.fxmag.pl/) that will be published later. Excerpt from the [full report](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/blob/master/reports/20181116-Blockchain-Fiesta-Krakow.md): "Some of the conference speakers that we engaged with were well impressed with Decred's forethought and the 'build first, hype second' ethos". ([TV news](https://krakow.tvp.pl/39996203/kryptowaluty-przyszlosc-platnosci-xxi-wieku) coverage, photos: [album](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOhLa_L0g5NrBWzKFTxMeDD7VJeUBzHzEyker-DRdZGuQoXS9ogpN3waxW26vj0CQ?key=Ty1jZ1NYRkdTY0dRRmNLc1JGcTdNby1BUlZ0eGZ3))
* [Blockchain Melbourne](https://www.meetup.com/BlockchainMelbourne/events/256295215/) in Melbourne, Australia. @eSizeDave introduced Decred, followed by two presenters from Apollo Capital. They first introduced their services and talked about how they do project analysis and due diligence, with an emphasis on the points where Decred checks the boxes, then spoke specifically about Decred. From the notes: "A great well-educated crowd. Quite surprised we got such a good crowd for investment analysis, with only about 1.5 weeks promotion, plus a bloodbath hash war market." and "It should be noted that the bulk of the credit goes to @Zohand here as he has a longer standing relationship with Apollo Capital.". Announcement discussion is [here](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154165462111747igExP:decred.org), post-event notes with more insights are [here](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154271915121075kJobf:decred.org) and [here](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154312938324664CVmxQ:decred.org). ([photos](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154271920421079Uwail:decred.org))
* [Lessons from DevCon4 & Web3 Summit](https://www.meetup.com/Web3-Melbourne/events/bnrhmqyxpblc/) in Melbourne, Australia. From @eSizeDave: "the event is held at the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub. The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) is a university in Melbourne and the first in Australia to establish its own dedicated blockchain innovation hub as part of its School of Economics. (...) The official organizers have recently returned from Devcon in Prague, and will present on lessons learnt from the conference. They attended our event on Nov 20 and asked us and Apollo Capital to present on Decred, and specifically Politeia.". The event was mostly Ethereum people, but the Politeia presentation by James from Apollo Capital [seemed](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154340368426560pechG:decred.org) to go well. ([photos](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$154340368426560pechG:decred.org))
* Dinner with Decred in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. @joshuam introduced Decred. The organizers ([@BitcoinSaigon](https://twitter.com/BitcoinSaigon)) then [noted](https://www.facebook.com/BitcoinSaigon/posts/938886146306840): "Some very interesting and fundamental conversations around the essence, importance and viability of decentralized systems were sparked last night. Very refreshing discussions in a time where marketing fluff seems to rule over substance in the space."

Upcoming:

* [The North American Bitcoin Conference](https://btcmiami.com/) in Miami, USA on Jan 16-18. @jy-p will give a 15 minute presentation on the main stage on Politeia. He'll also explore a wide variety of applications that could utilize Politeia, including cryptocurrency, corporate, and governmental. Examples include tokens, record keeping and voting systems. Decred will also have a 10'x8' exhibit booth, so we'll need to put a team together. We're looking for community members to join us to work the show. Please message @Dustorf if you're interested.
* [Campus Party](http://brasil.campus-party.org/cpbr12/patrocinadores/) in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Feb 12-17. Decred will have speakers and an exclusive area for hackathons.
* [Jalisco Talent Land](https://www.talent-land.mx/#entradas) in Guadalajara, Mexico on Apr 22-26. Decred will have a 3x3 m booth with 10 conference passes. @elian will present an overview of Decred (45 min) with Q&A (15 min), plus there will be a two hour breakout session where we'll walk through How to Use Decrediton, Staking Process, Lifescycle of a Ticket, and How to Use Politeia. Contact @elian if you're interested in helping/attending.

The weak aspects noted by the report are low social media activity, low trading volume and high liquidity risk. The strong aspects are hybrid PoW+PoS system that balances holders, miners and developers, experienced development team and better sovereignty of the community enabled by voting systems.

## Markets

The crypto market saw a $70 billion drop in November with most of the top 100 assets by marketcap losing 30% to 60% of USD value. Bitcoin established an aggregated low at $3,606 after dropping from its monthly high of $6,540 making a total 45% peak-bottom spread. Between Nov 14-15 most top 100 assets lost 10-20% USD value in a single day - one day before the infamous BCH split. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ginaclarke/2018/11/27/latest-crypto-crash-caused-by-bitcoin-civil-war-say-experts/1) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/crypto-winter-comes-early-as-bitcoin-slide-spurs-viability-fears) attributed the BTC dump to the Bitcoin Cash fork, the latter citing fear, uncertainty and doubt of some guys. At the end of the month both coins emerged from the fork as sustained new chains but together the price is 40% less than pre-fork lows. Others like [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/major-cryptocurrencies-drop-again-bitcoin-111026294.html) attribute the [SEC rulings](http://www.bitcoinpower101.com/2018/11/24/the-secs-recent-rulings-are-more-about-exchanges-than-icos/) about ICOs to the drop.

Decred was not immune to the market movement and saw a drop from $40 to $19.8 at end of month.

## Relevant External

Nvidia [reported](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nvidia-q3-results-reveal-crypto-hangover-due-to-disappearance-of-miner-sales) a drop in GPU sales for mining. This must have nothing to do with Ethereum, Zcash and others receiving ASICs for their GPU-oriented mining algorithms, but rather "it is really the canary in the coal mine for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies" per [the experts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/crypto-winter-comes-early-as-bitcoin-slide-spurs-viability-fears). Seriously guys, it is the [collapse](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-15/nvidia-gives-weak-forecast-citing-inventory-stock-slumps) of cryptocurrency mining.

[New study](https://twitter.com/C_Bendiksen/status/1068221424777814016) of Bitcoin mining gives some breakeven and mining cost estimates and suggests that some miners are shutting down equipment. Another interesting finding is that nearly 80% of energy used comes from renewables.

A paper was [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8) in Nature Climate journal that suggests Bitcoin PoW mining will have significant negative impact on climate change. [Discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!NKtIRqGOEGaZvSQkKl:decred.org/$15412120277994HzToF:decred.org) in #random noted serious misunderstandings of how PoW works and alarmingly low quality of the paper, along with some guesses about why it was published.

Ethereum Foundation is funding [efforts](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-foundation-filecoin-back-plan-to-make-proof-of-stake-hardware) to create ASICs that compute [Verifiable Delay Function](https://vdfresearch.org/) (VDF) as a replacement for Proof-of-Work mining for blockchain security.

This ASIC-resistant, GPU-friendly algorithm was also [proposed](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0aaab331075d08cb03333d5a1bef04b99a708dcbfebc8f8c94040ceb1676e684) on Politeia recently.

Zcash is [looking into](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/announcing-zcash-blossom-and-proposed-feature-goals/31891) hybrid ASIC-GPU mining, among other improvements planned for next year's protocol upgrade.

According to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9sq0jj/shady_behavior_from_groestlcoin_grs_developers/), yet another coin with claimed ASIC resistance received an ASIC, while the developers removed ASIC resistance claims from the website. Reddit thread that questioned this was [wiped out](https://archive.today/SzoHs). An instance where transparent censorship could be useful. (_missed in Oct issue_)

A new core library written in Rust was [released](https://github.com/brentongunning/rust-bch) for Bitcoin Cash. This adds to existing [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin), [parity-bitcoin](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bitcoin) and [bitcrust](https://github.com/tomasvdw/bitcrust). Rust is another modern language besides Go that aims for safety and performance. It's nice to see this software emerging since it may be useful for Decred, which is open to multiple implementations.

Bitcoin Cash, born as a solution to the long-running Bitcoin scaling debate, itself had a contentious hard fork this month. This [article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/when-fork-forks-what-you-need-know-bitcoin-cash-goes-war/) has a good summary of what the fork was about. The sides came to be referred to by their dominant software implementation, Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision. BCH ABC was planning a hard fork to add canonical transaction ordering and a new OP code - BCH SV rejects these changes and plans instead to return to a set of rules based on Bitcoin version 0.1.0.

Miners and oracles seemed to be split relatively evenly between the two sides, with Roger Ver and Jihan Wu on the ABC side and Craig S Wright and Calvin Ayre on the BCH SV side. This contentious hard fork was even more contentious than most, as the BCH SV side announced that they would nullify the replay protection added by ABC (another [good article](https://medium.com/circle-research/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-report-4e4377d514a) about the run-up to the fork). SV actually planned to mitigate ABC's replay protection by allowing miners to collect any BCH transferred using the new ABC OP codes - so that the use of these new features would result in the loss of BCH on the SV chain. There were also threats to attack the ABC chain and kill it, or make it unusable for long periods, should the SV chain have sufficient hashpower.

This [post on r/btc](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9xasgg/bitcoin_cash_hard_fork_mega_thread/) compiled a list of resources for following the fork as it played out. The [cash.coin.dance](https://cash.coin.dance/) site has a number of tools for keeping track of the fork in real-time. This [article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/one-day-after-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-takeaways-and-latest-developments/) has a good report from 24 hours after the fork. @richardred has written a short perspective on this [Hash War Theatre](https://medium.com/@richardred/hash-war-theater-67d3fcac3e97) also. On Nov 26 the SV side backed off and declared that the hash war was [over](https://coingeek.com/original-bitcoin-reborn-bitcoin-sv-bsv-bch-hash-war-ends/), they would allow both chains to co-exist in peace. With both chains seemingly being allowed to co-exist by the balance of mining power, it seems like the costs in this case are to be expressed primarily in terms of community fragmentation and aggravation. The BCH holder community in this case did not really have a role to play or way to affect the outcome, it was one for the miners to hash out.

Feels good to have Decred tickets that can be used to prevent sustained contentious chain splits, and to punish miners who turn the chain into a vehicle for their own power plays, should that ever become a problem.

This month also saw the launch of [SharkPool](https://www.ccn.com/war-bitcoin-cash-startup-launches-mining-pool-to-attack-altcoins-bch-forks/), a startup which aims to attack other Bitcoin forked chains by mining empty blocks and selling the profits for BCH.

There appears to be some drama in the RChain community, involving people being laid off and a possible fork. It is difficult to find any sources about this beyond this [blog post](https://joshyorndorff.com/blog/keeping-the-rchain-community-together). This is not the first internal conflict for RChain, since it itself was born out of a disagreement inside Synereo project which has led to a split in the past ([discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!tIDEIWechmqCLjPiui:decred.org/$154272469321222NLqFX:decred.org))

Looking at all the fighting in other communities I (@bee) can't help but insert a personal comment. It appears to me that communities waste a ton of energy on all the controversies. This energy is not building value. Chain splits and community splits leave both sides with less people, less talent, and less chances to make any long term impact. It is ironic that in a space of programmed decentralized consensus systems so many people fail to achieve human consensus. Decred manages to keep moving at its decent speed because it avoids external, and more importantly, internal conflicts. Let us keep incentives aligned and keep the community together.

Aragon [released](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-06-is-live-on-mainnet/) a new version on Oct 30 which allows users to create organizations on the Ethereum mainnet. Prior to this, 15,000+ organizations had apparently been created through previous versions on Ethereum testnets. Aragon can be used to create an "organization", add members and assign them tokens, and then hold signal votes with those tokens. The community also recently voted [overwhelmingly](https://twitter.com/AragonProject/status/1063590019749855237) (99.97%!) to approve [AGP-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aragon/AGPs/8c945258fc58c842752a49946514815a4fdd971d/AGPs/AGP-1.md), a Governance Proposal Process.

The [NavCoin community fund](https://navcoin.org/en/community-fund/) was [launched](https://medium.com/@NAVCoin/community-fund-activated-edc72207a0c0) on Nov 16. NavCoin's community fund operates on "dual-vote consensus", with an initial vote to decide if a proposal is approved or not, and then a subsequent vote to determine whether the payout should be made (after the work is done). Voters are participants in NavCoin staking, and vote with the weight of their stake. The community fund receives 0.25 NAV from each block minted, 500K NAV per year, or around $93K at today's prices. Proposal voting lasts for one week and requires participation of 50% of stakers, with 70% approval required for acceptance.

UK government canceled a [stablecoin project](https://github.com/BitGo/prova) based on a fork of btcd. [@alexbosworth noted](https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/1056318062176145414): "The thing about stablecoins is that one day someone can come along and cancel the whole thing.".

Security news: Seven new Spectre and Meltdown attacks were [revealed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/researchers-discover-seven-new-meltdown-and-spectre-attacks/) that impact Intel, AMD and ARM CPUs to various degrees. This is following a new Intel Hyper-Threading [vulnerability](https://thehackernews.com/2018/11/portsmash-intel-vulnerability.html) discovered earlier same month. These revelations continue to show that we need safer and more open hardware to run our cryptocurrencies.

SMS, and relying on mobile operators in general, shown to be a bad choice for 2FA. In this [recent incident](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/15/millions-sms-text-messages-leaked-two-factor-codes/), a server not even protected with a password leaked millions of SMS messages containing 2FA codes, password resets and other sensitive information nearly in real-time. In another case, lawsuits [like this](https://www.coindesk.com/victims-sue-att-t-mobile-over-sim-swap-crypto-hacks/) will hopefully push cellular providers to improve security, but they won't get your coins back. Speaking even more generally, most smartphones have a [baseband chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseband_processor) and other proprietary parts - nobody really knows what they are doing or how vulnerable they are.

Headphone software [was caught](https://twitter.com/spazef0rze/status/1067583791596781570) installing a root certificate that can potentially be abused to impersonate websites.

Copay wallet was infected with malware to steal cryptocurrency. If you used this wallet or one derived from it, you may need to move your coins to a new seed. This [coverage](https://thehackernews.com/2018/11/nodejs-event-stream-module.html) includes details like affected software and versions. The cause was repository compromise of one of the npm dependencies. No known Decred software was affected.

Quite a lot of security troubles this month, but hopefully these warnings will help to educate and keep your coins safe.
