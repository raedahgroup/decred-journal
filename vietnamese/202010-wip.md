Decred's highlights in October:

- v1.6.0 had its first two release candidates, following community testing fixes and improvements are being rolled into a third release candidate which is coming soon.
- The initial release of the dcrdex MVP on mainnet accompanied the first v1.6.0 release candidate. CLI users can now add dcrdex to the installation by adding an extra argument to the install command.
- The attention of many community members has now turned to making the most of the proper v1.6 release when it happens, check the Outreach section to see what they're planning.
- Politeia celebrated 2 years in production, congratulations to the people behind the 47 approved proposals and the stakeholders who voted for them.

## DCRDEX Initial Release

A little more than a year since the [RFP](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5431da8) and [development](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/417607a) proposals have been approved on Politeia, Decred users can now trade between DCR and BTC without risking their funds and personal information with custodial exchanges.

First MVP [release](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/release-v0.1.0) was followed by a quick [v0.1.1](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/release-v0.1.1) patch release that is currently the latest.

Visit [dex.decred.org](https://dex.decred.org/) to get started, or follow the [guide](https://www.publish0x.com/block-commons/how-to-get-on-dcrdex-mvp-xolpzmv) by @richardred, or just see it in action in a [video](https://twitter.com/Decred_News/status/1320184172749721600). Latest price and order books can be viewed at dcrdata's [Market](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/market) dashboard, with more public data to follow.

> I want to thank ALL of our earlier testers for your feedback and patience as we get this thing moving. We have taken a lot of the feedback into account, and resolved a number of UI/UX issues, and fixed a couple of bugs that have popped up in match recovery scenarios. ([@chappjc](https://matrix.to/#/!mlRZqBtfWHrcmgdTWB:decred.org/$AQsNUyN7WWfYR6IhOgtGckBAecXP5ASXCYKFBpNWrcM))

Congratulations everyone with the release!

## v1.6 Release Candidates

Release candidates for dcrd, dcrwallet, Decrediton and dcrlnd are available for testing [here](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases). Please bear in mind that while key features are there and working in Decrediton, a number of UI improvements and bug fixes are forthcoming in a third release candidate.

As always, [verify the binaries](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries/) before running them.

Version 1.6 will be one of the biggest releases Decred ever made. If you would like to help with outreach please check that [section](#outreach) below.

## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

v1.6 Release Candidate 1 and 2 have been made for public testing. You can read the RC2 release notes and get the source code [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.6.0-rc2). Bug reports are welcome [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues).

Work included in v1.6 release:

- mining code changed to prioritize transactions with higher [aggregate fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1829) based on its ancestors in the mempool (aka Child Pays for Parent)
- ticket [exhaustion](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2398) check to prevent a theoretical scenario when the ticket pool goes too low and the chain can become unrecoverable if certain blocks are added
- optimized block template generation for [disapproved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2397) blocks
- multiple tweaks and fixes for the new treasury code
- tool for generating certificates [rewritten](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2425) to support more use cases (like not including hostname and interface in the certificate or specify any of the 4 supported algorithms)
- improved chain generation [test harness](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2329)
- fixed database [migration](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2446) to support upgrading from v1.4
- for upgrading from even older clients where the database is too old to migrate, redownloading the chain from scratch was [automated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2449) to not require any manual intervention from the user

Continued merged work past the v1.6 branching point:

- continued the saga to cover [rpcserver](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2069) with tests
- `mining` package reorganized for easier testing and navigation

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- allow wallet accounts to be individually [encrypted](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1823) and unlocked, each with its own passphrase
- commands to query and set [voting policy](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1897) for treasury spend transactions created by particular keys
- commands to set voting policy for [individual](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1905) tspend transactions
- require [TLS certificate](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1867) authentication for gRPC clients and allow it for JSON-RPC clients. This is a more secure way for programs to talk to dcrwallet. Other projects were updated to support this change (Decrediton, Politeia, dcrlnd, and others).
- allow gRPC clients to [lock/unlock](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1883) wallet once and then call methods without a [passphrase](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1880)
- better handling of [low](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1875) [balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1879) when purchasing tickets
- track [status](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1866) of vspd ticket fees to handle failures of vspd's fee processing
- multiple fixes for vspd staking
- fixes for new `getminingstate` and `getinitstate` messages

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- LN [Watchtowers](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2638) support
- multiple UI/UX improvements for [LN views](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2641)
- initial auto [ticket buyer](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2577) for the new vspd
- manual ticket [purchasing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2729) with the new vspd
- initial integration of ticket purchasing combined with [CSPP](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2773)
- [listing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2747) of vspd tickets
- [migrated](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2705) from the deprecated [trezor.js](https://github.com/trezor/trezor.js) to Trezor [Connect API](https://github.com/trezor/connect)
- show SPV mode [icon](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2666) on the sidebar
- show [peer count](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2685) on the sidebar
- new tab for ticket [status](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2813)
- remember [last used](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2789) VSP
- highlight misplaced seed words on [seed entry](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2683) view
- updated [Portuguese](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2782) translation
- continued refactoring to functional components and CSS modules
- ~60 bug fixes

In progress:

- Trezor [staking](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2681) support. Since it might take a long time for the required [changes](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/1249) in Trezor firmware to get merged upstream, Decred devs have [decided](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2681#issuecomment-714265711) to try our own custom firmware.
- automated UI [testing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2659)

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

- inline Markdown [images](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2158)
- bug fixes and UI tweaks for Politeia and CMS

In progress:

- automated [UI testing](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2151)

Update on tlog backend migration:

> We have a testnet instance up and are still in the process of testing everything and fixing bugs. Inclusion proof routes and test coverage are also in the works. (@lukebp)

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

- optimizations and bug fixes

**[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool)**

- support for [DCP-6](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/252) treasury upgrade
- [dust](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/254) payments to pool participants will be forfeited as pool fees. One reason for that is dust payments would fail the payout transaction anyway. Another is it serves as an incentive to contribute enough resources to the pool to get a normal payout when it mines a block and to discourage contributing intermittent, sporadic work.
- a lot of work was put in to support [Postgres](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/issues/257) as a database backend
- show pending and archived [pool fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/249) payments on the admin page
- refactored [reward payment](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/250) code
- many improvements to test code

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

- updated to [lnd v0.11.1](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/103) code by porting hundreds of upstream commits. To feel the scale of the porting work you can check [this](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/blob/master/docs/upstream-prs.csv) list of upstream changes processed.
- updated to latest dcrd and dcrwallet

dcrlnd is preparing v0.3.0 to be released together with the big v1.6 release of core software (dcrd, dcrwallet, Decrediton). Release notes are [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/blob/master/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.3.0.md).

**[dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)**

Most of the work merged in October was included in the initial [v0.1.0](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/release-v0.1.0) and follow-up [v0.1.1](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/release-v0.1.1) releases.

- added configurable target number of confirmations for [redeem](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/739) transactions (they do not have to be mined as quickly as swap tx so it is possible to save on fees)
- generation of new [deposit](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/769) addresses
- client [Tor support](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/738)

- data transfer [limits](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/754) for clients until they log in
- mainnet [instructions](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/764) in the README
- numerous bug fixes

A total of 48 PRs from 7 contributors were [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-10-01..2020-10-31+sort%3Aupdated-asc), adding 11K and deleting 5K lines of code.

## Governance

In October the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 12,388 DCR and spent 14,748 DCR. Using October's daily average rate of $12.01 per DCR, this is $149K received and $177K spent. At September's average daily rate of $13.26, the USD figure billed for past work is $196K. As of Nov 4, Treasury balance is 638,044 DCR (7.9 million USD at $12.38).

The candidate proposals for the [RFP proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) to change messaging on decred.org (approved in Sep) were voted on, but none of these were approved. Results were as follows:

- [D.R.E.A.M.](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4532397) - 48% approval, turnout of 29% (_The Decred Chad ignored the disapproval and continued anyway, because Chad_)
- ["Money Evolved"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/02d9fc2) tagline with minimal changes to the site - 25% approval, turnout of 25%
- Decred - Building Revolutionary [Infrastructure](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d6ff458) - 16% approval, turnout of 18%
- "Money Evolved" tagline - plus ["Fair"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f0a00d5) box and page added to the site - 7% approval, turnout of 17%

A content and asset translation [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c093b8a) by @kozel was submitted in Oct and approved in early Nov with 75% approval and 28% turnout. This proposal will cover the translation of Decred publications and assets into 6-8 languages, with a maximum budget of $33,000 to cover 6 months of work. The proposal is staffed by people who have a [record](https://github.com/decredcommunity/translations/blob/master/index.md) of delivering translations of Decred content.

Politeia Digest [issue 37](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue037/) and [issue 38](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue038/) have more details on the month's proposals.

A pre-proposal from Paris Smithson for the WhyDecred.com site was [announced](https://twitter.com/ParisSmithson/status/1318278630208901126) on Twitter, discussed on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jkmhbv/whydecredcom_proposal_open_talk/), and finally landed on [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/8a09324) in early Nov.

@richardred published a [report](https://blockcommons.red/publication/politeia-at-2/) of Politeia activity for its second year of operation. Some highlights:

- 46 proposals published, 21 approved, 17 rejected, 6 abandoned
- 3 proposals failed to reach quorum (didn't happen in year 1)
- average (mean) turnout was 27.9%, down 3.3% from year 1
- average (mean) approval for passed proposals was 79%, down from 86% in year 1
- there were more marketing proposals than in year 1
- 48% of proposals came from contractors (up from 35% in year 1), and these are still more likely to be approved
- 10 of the proposals in year 2 were requesting the renewal of funding, and these had an 80% success rate
- proposals with hourly pay were more likely to pass than fixed cost

## Network

Hashrate: October's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kfoi5rmw-kgziese8&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at 450 Ph/s and closed 225 Ph/s, bottoming at 185 Ph/s and peaking at 551 Ph/s throughout the month. Pool hashrate [distribution](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) as of Nov 1: Poolin 37%, UUPool 37%, Antpool 13%, Huobipool 9%, F2Pool 1.2%, BTC.com 1%, easy2mine 0.9%, Luxor 0.6%, CoinMine 0.02%.

On Oct 25 the hashrate dropped to 260 and continued all the way down to 185 Ph/s on Oct 28. Quick recovery started on the first days of Nov.

Staking: [30-day average](https://dcrstats.com/) ticket price was 151.7 DCR (+3.1).

## Integrations

[stakey.net](https://stakey.net/) is the first mainnet VSP running the new vspd software. It has [voted](https://stakey.net/vspd-stats/) 13 tickets and 40 are live as of Nov 11.

> Our first private ticket purchase using a VSP just verified on chain. It was purchased without an account, using funds mixed by CoinShuffle++ via the Tor onion service. Stick that in your pipe and smoke it, Surveillance Daddy! ([@stakeynet](https://twitter.com/stakeynet) on Twitter)

## Outreach

@Checkmate is calling all Decred stakeholders to prepare for the release of the Hidden Hydra aka Decred v1.6. Discussions in Forward Thinking Fridays [Oct 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jc6qjq/forward_thinking_friday_160_time_to_shine_16/) and [Oct 23](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jgzs57/forward_thinking_friday_23_october_2020_the/), and one other call to [organize](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ji9gm4/calling_all_stakeholders_prepare_to_release_the/) have collected dozens of ideas what can be done to get the word out about Decred v1.6 and DCRDEX. A cheat sheet with everything a Decred advocate might need is being assembled [here](https://github.com/decredcommunity/outreach/pull/12) (help is welcome).

Decred Latam published [4th report](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/proposals/3c02b67/updates/20201012.md) of their second proposal that lists all notable events, media presence, business development and finances. A notable strategy being explored is developer outreach and onboarding in Spanish:

- 4 episodes of Código Decred released since July: Introduction to [Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFX0P9MKLKg), Exploring Decred with [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGhklclRNt0), [Verifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3BwnmmF1Ro) Decred binaries, and [DCR Wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2SeVZqnO9A)
- intro to blockchain and [dcrdata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSmdwWykmSo) workshop was held in October
- new [@decredES_devs](https://t.me/decredES_devs) Telegram channel has 70+ users as of writing

A long-running Blockchain Learning and Development [Challenge](https://www.talentland.talent-republic.tv/challenge/blockchain-learning-challenge-decred/) by Decred Latam was opened for registration in October and will run until December 9. In Phase 1 participants will attend workshops to learn about Bitcoin and blockchain, DAOs, governance, dcrdata API etc. In Phase 2 they will need to build an original project using Decred public blockchain data, release it with ISC license and present in a 3-minute video pitch. All comms, mentoring and support will take place in @decredES\_devs Telegram. 3 winners will get $1,500, $700 and $300 in DCR. 90+ people from 8+ Latam countries have registered so far.

@michae2xl published a [report](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/proposals/bc20f98/updates/20201102.md) of his October activities for the Brazil Marketing proposal.

@pavel announced that a new withDecred.org giveaway [campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jhb5do/withdecred_on_twitter_new_earned_giveaway_campaign/) is live. It uses a smart combination of QR codes and Twitter to maximize engagement and spreading of the message at the same time.

New website [WhyDecred.com](https://whydecred.com/) by Paris Smithson has a draft version up for [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jkmhbv/whydecredcom_proposal_open_talk/) and feedback. This project takes the big picture approach by first explaining all the problems with _money_ we have today, and then explaining how Decred solves them. Quality artwork will be used to communicate. A formal [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/8a09324) to fund the completion of the website is now being discussed.

A new project [winatoms.com](https://winatoms.com/) by @buck54321 is up for testing. Users can create and solve each other's [puzzles](https://winatoms.com/challenge/TckpZfv9RMCtTkPfFyfGjV7wjfeurpPoky7), winning DCR if the submitted solution is correct. Currently it only works with testnet DCR and project status is "prototype for discussion". Follow [@winatoms](https://twitter.com/winatoms) on Twitter for updates.

## Markets

In October DCR was trading between USD 11.17-13.84 / BTC 0.00085-0.00124. The average daily rate was $12.01.

[dcrdex](https://dex.decred.org/) was reported to have traded a total of 4 BTC on [Oct 26](https://matrix.to/#/!mlRZqBtfWHrcmgdTWB:decred.org/$vfxOI7g-SkKc1nMIOid39Wm_Lk1OOSx-6TFxLOmkWAI) and 25 BTC on [Oct 28](https://matrix.to/#/!aNnAOHkWUdNcEXRGjJ:decred.org/$BUsJJwTfvakxhAxuvgxYefQBgaJCe3oIaf6iPyDtY30).

Bitcoin fees have [skyrocketed](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,1y) to values unseen for a long time at the end of Oct, which made dcrdex transactions more expensive. The mempool was cleared during the first week of November and fees went back to normal.

dcrdex order books can be viewed at dcrdata's [Market](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/market) dashboard. Volume data will follow.

Mario Laul of Placeholder identified [ten theses](https://medium.com/@mariolaul/ten-theses-on-decentralized-network-governance-c1a24a9d59c7) on decentralized network governance. This high level decomposition of core principles driving the networks gives another way to look at Decred.

> good network governance aligns the interests of all stakeholders through a sufficiently flexible system of checks and balances. Imbalanced governance or inability to resolve conflicts between key stakeholders creates instability, which is particularly problematic for networks positioned to become systemically important administrative infrastructure with a very large user base.

IOHK has distributed $250K worth of ADA to Project Catalyst, which will fund projects proposed by the community. According to [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-s-treasury-concept-is-about-to-get-its-first-real-world-test-drive-with-project-catalyst), "Charles Hoskinson is a big proponent of decentralized treasuries, which he believes to be one of the greatest innovations of our time".

A paper on atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Monero was [published](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126) in September and a corresponding [proposal](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/h4sh3d-atomic-swap-implementation.html) was funded on Monero's Community Crowdfunding System, raising 2.7K XMR ($340K) in just 4 days. Another group [iterated](https://medium.com/comit-network/monero-bitcoin-atomic-swap-1cab015d7af9) further on the protocol to use 2-of-2 multisig scripts that are common in Bitcoin.

The OKEx cryptocurrency exchange, based in Malta, has [suspended](https://www.coindesk.com/okex-suspends-withdrawals) all cryptocurrency withdrawals because a key-holder is indisposed, because they are "currently cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations". The suspension was [still](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/okex-withdrawal-suspension) in place a week later, despite a whale alert and social media furore about a large transfer to Binance, but this turned out to be [mislabelled](https://twitter.com/philip_gradwell/status/1317120228510359552).

US Department of Justice [released](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-announces-publication-cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework) Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework that provides an overview of the crypto space and its illicit uses, existing laws, and current challenges and strategies to address them. Similar to FinCEN [guidance](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf) from May 2019, the document is most relevant to custodial services.

Komodo [announced](https://komodoplatform.com/community-update-on-atomicdex-kyc-aml/) that they will be implementing KYC/AML procedures on the AtomicDEX liquidity network that is officially supported by the developers, even though the exchange is non-custodial. The announcement mentions another thing to worry about besides the recent regulatory action: "there is a buyback and token swap concerning security-like tokens that underpin AtomicDEX operations, including assets like DEX token, SuperNET assets, and any revenue-sharing token".

CFTC [charged](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8270-20) BitMEX owners for operating an unregistered trading platform and violating CFTC regulations, including failing to implement AML procedures.

FinCEN issued a $60M [fine](https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-fines-bitcoin-mixing-ceo-60m-in-landmark-crackdown-on-helix-coin-ninja) to the owner of a Bitcoin mixer who was arrested in February. The service was [custodial](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-coin-mixers-legal-crosshairs/).

Coinbase released its first transparency [report](https://blog.coinbase.com/transparency-at-coinbase-c8edf6dce4d6) with a breakdown of law enforcement requests received in the first half of 2020.

PayPal [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-new-york-conditional-bitlicense-paxos-cryptocurrency) that it will allow users to buy BTC, ETH, BCH, and LTC with its app. The initial version will not allow deposits, withdrawals, or sending crypto to other PayPal accounts. The company has a [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) of arbitrarily frozen accounts and associated lawsuits.

Dustin Dreifuerst of [Did You Know Podcast](https://didyouknowcrypto.com/ep26/) warns of a [scenario](https://medium.com/@dustindreifuerst/the-coming-bitcoin-war-ff3e96db3aad) where an influx of institutional investment will lead to a conflict with principles crypto was founded on.

Tether [reversed](https://cryptobriefing.com/tether-can-freeze-destroy-your-usdt/) a $1 million transaction in September by a user who erroneously sent the funds to the smart contract for the DeFi platform Swerve.

The DeFi protocol harvest.finance was [hacked](https://cryptobriefing.com/hackers-drain-defi-protocol-harvest-finance-24-million/) for $24 million with a flash loan that manipulated the price of a stablecoin on Curve's Y pool.

Missed last month, Andre Cronje (of YFI) [deployed](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1310763506170499072) contracts for a new "Eminence" gaming platform, within a few hours $15 million had been deposited, and it was then all taken by a hacker. The attacker then [returned](https://www.coindesk.com/eminence-exploit-defi-compensated) $8 million to a YFI smart contract controlled by Cronje, and this was distributed to victims of the hack.

Popular DeFi character Blue Kirby is not popular anymore, after a [rollercoaster](https://thedailygwei.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-blue-kirby-the) 3 months in which they went from 0 to 20,000 followers on Twitter, got a job with Yearn earning $7K/month, sold 500 ETH worth of Kirby NFTs, and received 25 YFI from Andre Cronje himself. Things started going wrong for Kirby when they encouraged people to pile into the beta Eminence contracts which got hacked, got a little worse when they cashed in all their YFI and were called out, then there was an episode with some new "Off-Blue" tokens that Kirby was promoting which people found to be suspicious. Someone apparently threatened to doxx Blue Kirby, and they disappeared, deleting their accounts and leaving with an estimated $1 million.

Uniswap held the [first](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/1) and [second](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2) votes of its new UNI-based governance system, both failing with 97-98% approval but only Yes votes from 3.75%-3.96%, while the minimum quorum to pass is Yes votes from 4% of the UNI tokens. The first proposal sought to lower the requirement for submitting a proposal, at present the proposer must have or be delegated at least 1% of all UNI, and for passing the quorum requirement (from 4% to 3%). The first two proposals were created by the same actors, including Dharma protocol and Gauntlet. The second proposal sought to extend the initial airdrop to Uniswap users who interacted with proxy contracts, with ~20% of the addresses to receive these tokens being Dharma users. This led some participants to [frame](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/urgent-discussion-on-current-vote-reduce-uni-governance-proposal-quorum-thresholds/7117) the proposals as a kind of takeover attempt.

GitHub has taken down the repository of the popular [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) project that allows to download video files from YouTube without dealing with its browser UI. This is a reminder of what may happen to all GitHub data not sored in Git repositories, which is especially relevant when design discussions and decisions are stored in issues and pull requests outside of Git.

Samsung is [integrating](https://cryptonews.com/news/samsung-adds-anti-money-laundering-features-to-it-crypto-wal-7911.htm) AML checks into their phones to make everyone safer.

UK Government published an international [statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-statement-end-to-end-encryption-and-public-safety) on end-to-end encryption, co-signed by representatives from the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, and Japan ([mirrored](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety) on the DoJ website). The statement calls for tech companies to inject backdoors, for public safety. Matrix team posted a [response](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/) explaining why compromising everyone's security and privacy to combat abuse by the minority of bad actors is fundamentally flawed and proposed alternative measures.
